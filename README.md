# Implementation Overview

# React Component Structure:  
Divide your game into components such as Board, Square, and Game to manage the game state and UI elements efficiently.

# Game Logic: 
Implement game mechanics to handle placing X's and O's alternately on the board, detecting win conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), and handling ties.

# State Management:
Use React's state to manage the state of each square on the board, current player turn, and game status (win, tie, ongoing).

# UI Design:
Ensure your UI matches the provided design, including board layout, styling of squares, and visual cues for game state (current player turn, win/tie messages).

# Event Handling: 
Implement event handlers to respond to user clicks on squares, updating the game state accordingly.

# Win Condition Detection: 
Implement algorithms to check for win conditions after each move to determine if a player has won.

# Tie Handling:
Check for a tie condition where all squares are filled but no player has won.
